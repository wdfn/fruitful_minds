`Curriculum Review Director, Nutritional Sciences', `students',

`<p>Jessica has been a member of the Fruitful Minds student board since fall 2010 as creative director and grant co-manager. In both of these roles she articulates the goals of the organization so that foundations, corporations and the public have a clear understanding of what Fruitful Minds is, how the work concerns them and why they should get involved. Longtime interests in puzzle-solving, reading, journaling, creativity and amateur photography and scrapbooking have developed her abilities in writing, editing and formatting. She has put these to use in crafting asking letters and grants as well as marketing and educational materials for the organization.</p>

<p>A fourth year student in nutritional sciences, she is uncertain about a future career path but knows that food and health are two of the most important things in life. She wants to see the deepening of nutrition knowledge, growth of its influence in medical practice and innovative public health interventions. Working with an organization that seeks to provide nutrition education in a powerful way is a step toward becoming part of this vision.</p>

<p>She has a handful of teachers passionate about grammar and a summer internship with the talent-nurturing women at the Asian American Women Artists Association to thank for guiding her to this position at Fruitful Minds.</p>')
