`Marketing Director, Media Studies', `students',

`<p>Mai Hoang began working with Fruitful Minds in November 2010 to help determine the gardening, cooking, and nutrition priorities of schools across Alameda County school districts in the Bay Area.  She currently resides as Marketing Manager. Through this position, she coordinates the statistics, information, and data of schools in order for Fruitful Minds to begin its successful career.</p>

<p>Mai was born and raised in Huntington Beach, California. Students were educated about nutrition and health, but many standards were not implemented in schools. She noticed schools were trying to create healthier meal plans for students but healthy lifestyles were not strictly enforced. As an athlete for the majority of her life and with a brief year studying nutrition and gardening in seventh grade, Mai did not realize the importance of educating children about living healthy. It was not until she came to Berkeley and was introduced to Fruitful Minds that she saw an opportunity to help change the world through education.</p>

<p>Mai is currently an undergraduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. She is working towards her degree in Media Studies, and involved in several clubs and internships. As a member of the Fruitful Minds staff, she is also trying to follow a healthy lifestyle.</p>')
