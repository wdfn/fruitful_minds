<p>Originally from New York, Colleen studied biology and nutritional sciences at Cornell University. Her first experience with community nutrition was with a Farmers&apos; Market Nutrition Program in New York City, where she assisted with onsite cooking demos to promote fruit and vegetable purchases. Colleen followed her passion for healthy eating and volunteerism and after college served as an AmeriCorps VISTA with a nutrition education program targeting low-income populations, again in New York City.</p>

<p>Colleen made her way to the west coast to pursue an MPH in public health nutrition at the UC, Berkeley School of Public Health. In her time in the Bay Area, Colleen has also interned with the Community Alliance with Family Farmers and the Oakland Food Policy Council, two organizations working to improve access to healthy and sustainable food. Colleen looks forward to seeing Fruitful Minds&apos; continued growth and reach to communities in need.</p>')
